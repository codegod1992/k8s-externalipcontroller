Application Deployment Examples
===============================

The application can be run in one of the following operating modes:
* Simple mode
* Claims mode

You can get more information about operating modes in `Basic Modules and
Operating Modes` document.

Let's look at how to deploy the application in each of these modes.
There is a set of deployment configuration examples in `examples` directory
that we will use here.

We assume that:
* Public network (network for External IPs) is routable to nodes.
* We want to expose services to external clients via external IPs.
